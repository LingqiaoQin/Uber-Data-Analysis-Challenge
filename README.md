Uber Logins Time Series Analysis
Data Analysis Challenge: 
Weâ€™ve attached a JSON dataset of client logins from an Uber city on the eastern seaboard of 
the United Statues. Using this, please do the following:
1. Using your analysis tool of choice, please generate a graph showing an hourly breakdown 
of client login behavior. 
2. Fit a model that best describes this data. Provide reasoning as to why you choose this 
model vs others (basically we want to know the breadth of your knowledge and also if you 
know fundamental assumptions behind the model you choose). 
3. Can the above model you used to predict/forecast the future? If yes, then do so for a 
short-time frame (say next 2 weeks). What is the accuracy of your predictions? What changes 
would you do if we asked you to predict over longer horizon (say 15 weeks)?
